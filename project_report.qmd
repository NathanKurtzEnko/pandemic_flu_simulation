# Abstract

- Problem

- Previous approaches

- Novelty

- Key findings

# Background

- Define the scope and significance of flu pandemics.

- Briefly introduce modeling approaches, especially the SIR model.

## History

- State the purpose of the review: to explore how SIR-based models incorporate covariates such as altitude, obesity, and solar radiation.

- Overview of major flu pandemics (e.g., 1918, 2009 H1N1).

- Transmission dynamics and public health impact.

- Role of environmental and demographic factors in flu spread.

## Modeling

- Description of the basic SIR framework and its assumptions.

- Extensions: SEIR, age-structured, spatially explicit models.

- Strengths and limitations in modeling flu pandemics.

- Case studies using SIR models for H1N1, SARS, or seasonal influenza.

- Integration with real-world data: mobility, vaccination, and intervention strategies.

- Use of stochastic vs. deterministic approaches.

## Covariates

### Altitude

- Impact of altitude on viral transmission and host susceptibility.

- Studies linking high-altitude regions to delayed or reduced flu spread.

### Obesity

- Obesity as a risk factor for flu severity and transmission.

- How models account for population-level obesity rates.

### Solar Radiation

- Influence of UV radiation on virus viability and immune response.

- Seasonal patterns and their incorporation into predictive models.

# Method

- Data sources: WHO, CDC, climate databases, demographic surveys.

- Statistical and computational techniques for integrating covariates.

- Challenges in parameter estimation and model validation.

- Results: data visualization and tabulation, and implications.

# Discussion

## Future Work

- Underexplored covariates or regions.

- Need for interdisciplinary models combining epidemiology, climatology, and public health.

- Potential of machine learning to enhance traditional SIR frameworks.

## Conclusions

- Summary of key findings.

- Implications for pandemic preparedness and policy.

- Call for more nuanced, data-rich modeling approaches.
